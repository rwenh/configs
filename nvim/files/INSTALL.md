---

## What Was Changed (v2.1.1 → v2.2)

24. **Double-LSP clients eliminated** — rustaceanvim, typescript-tools, go.nvim, elixir-tools all set their respective servers to disabled so lsp.lua owns them exclusively

51. **commands.lua** — MasonInstallAll package names corrected (elixir-ls-debugger removed, cobol-language-server removed, vhdl-ls → rust_hdl, kotlin-debug-adapter removed)

---

## What Was Changed (v2.2.5 → v2.3.0)

52. **ui.lua — dashboard-nvim replaced with snacks.nvim**
    - `nvimdev/dashboard-nvim` removed; `folke/snacks.nvim` added with `dashboard` module enabled
    - Animated matrix rain header: real-time column-drop animation via `vim.uv` timer (80 ms ticks)
    - Each of 64 rain columns has independent head position, speed, and trail length
    - Characters drawn from katakana + hex + symbols pool; trail brightness decays per distance
    - `MatrixHead` / `MatrixTrail` / `MatrixMid` / `MatrixDim` highlight groups defined on ColorScheme autocmd (survive theme toggle)
    - Timer starts on `SnacksDashboardOpened`, stops on `SnacksDashboardClosed`
    - Logo + rotating quote rendered below rain, above menu; all other snacks modules disabled
    - lualine `disabled_filetypes` updated to include `snacks_dashboard`
53. **README.md** — Known Issues table added; structure updated for snacks; v2.3.0
54. **KEYMAP_REFERENCE.md** — `<leader>un` collision resolved; Elixir keymaps documented; session, treesitter text-object, `<leader>'P/w/W`, and `<leader>,i` keymaps added

---

## What Was Changed (v2.3.0 → v2.3.1 – v2.3.4)

55. **completion.lua** — version pinned to `"1.*"`; `<Tab>`/`<S-Tab>` stripped to snippet-only; `<C-n>`/`<C-j>` and `<C-p>`/`<C-k>` as exclusive menu-nav aliases; `cmdline` source removed from `sources.default`
56. **advanced.lua** — nvim-ufo: `close_fold_kinds` renamed to `close_fold_kinds_for_ft`; neogen marked as PRIMARY owner; cpp.lua and python.lua extend via `optional=true`; `<leader>xg` keymap lives here only
57. **python.lua** — iron.nvim REPL keymaps moved from `keymaps={}` in setup to per-buffer FileType autocmd; neogen spec `optional=true`; annotation convention corrected to `google_docstrings`
58. **cpp.lua** — neogen spec `optional=true`; duplicate `<leader>ccd` key entry removed; `config()` removed from optional extension spec
59. **dap.lua** — `load_breakpoints()` hooked to `User LazyDone` (was fragile `vim.defer_fn(100ms)`); JS/TS `pick_process` wrapped in function (lazy eval); `mason-nvim-dap handlers` key removed entirely to restore default adapter setup
60. **lsp.lua** — mason-lspconfig `handlers = { function() end }` added to suppress double-attach on Nvim 0.11; `vim.diagnostic.goto_next/prev` replaced with `vim.diagnostic.jump()` + 0.10 fallback; `<leader>,r` uses `:IncRename` shim for cmd-based lazy loading; `<leader>,o` changed from AerialToggle to `Trouble lsp_document_symbols`
61. **hud.lua** — TodoTelescope key moved from `<leader>ft` to `<leader>xT` (resolved conflict with Fortran `<leader>ft*` group)
62. **keymaps.lua** — removed duplicates owned by plugin `keys=` specs (`<leader>ee/ef/ec/er`, `<leader>uz`, `<leader>uT`, `<leader>eo`, `<leader>.p/.r/.B`); `<leader>ob` overseer fallback simplified; `<leader>xg` removed (owned by advanced.lua); `<leader>xx` fixed to `Trouble diagnostics toggle`
63. **autocmds.lua** — TrimWhitespace batched into single `nvim_buf_set_lines` call; `checktime` uses `vim.bo.buftype` not `vim.o.buftype`; LargeFile: `vim.treesitter.stop()` added; BufWinEnter re-stamps `foldmethod=manual` for large files
64. **treesitter.lua** — `foldexpr` updated to `v:lua.vim.treesitter.foldexpr()`
65. **test.lua** — neotest-rust deferred via one-shot FileType autocmd + `vim.schedule()`; neotest-go changed from raw module to `require("neotest-go")({})` constructor call
66. **runner.lua** — rust runner walks up 5 levels for Cargo.toml; elixir/ruby `run_tests()` prefixed with `cd <root> &&`; `bun.lock` text lockfile added alongside `bun.lockb`; path cache normalised with `fnamemodify(":p")`
67. **workflow.lua** — `overseer.run_template()` wrapped in pcall with OverseerRun fallback for both build and shell shortcuts
68. **options.lua** — `sessionoptions`: "terminal" and "help" removed; `auto_cd_root` initialised to `false` (opt-in)

---

## What Was Changed (v2.3.4 → v2.3.5)

69. **keymaps.lua — Spectre pcall guards** — `require("spectre")` was called bare in the `<leader>/s`, `<leader>/w`, and `<leader>/f` handlers. `nvim-spectre` only loads on `:Spectre` (cmd=); pressing these keys before that fired an unhandled `module not found` error. All three handlers now use `pcall` with a clear warning message.

70. **keymaps.lua — DAP keymaps pcall guards** — All inline `require("dap")`, `require("dapui")`, and `require("dap.ui.widgets")` calls in the `<leader>;*` and `F5`–`F11` maps were bare. If DAP failed to load (Mason not done, missing adapter) any of these keys threw an unhandled stack trace. All DAP keymaps now use a consistent pcall pattern with a `[dap] not loaded` notification on failure.

71. **keymaps.lua — `<leader>sm` MaximizerToggle removed** — mapped to `:MaximizerToggle` but no maximizer plugin was ever specced in the project. Pressing `<leader>sm` always silently failed. Replaced with a native Lua toggle using `vim.w._maximized` + `wincmd | wincmd _` / `wincmd =` — zero plugin dependency, correct per-window state.

72. **lsp.lua — conform v6 API fix** — The `fmt()` function inside `LspAttach` used `lsp_fallback = true` (conform v5 key, silently ignored on v6). Updated to `lsp_format = "fallback"`. The `format_on_save` closure was already correct; only the inline LSP-attach format handler was missed.

73. **commands.lua — conform v6 API fix** — Both call sites in the `:Format` command (ranged and whole-buffer) updated from `lsp_fallback = true` to `lsp_format = "fallback"` to match the lsp.lua fix and conform v6.

74. **test.lua — neotest-elixir constructor** — `neotest-elixir` was returned as a raw module table with a comment claiming "no constructor". This was true of `<v0.2` but neotest-elixir v0.2+ exports a callable. Changed to `require("neotest-elixir")({})` — identical fix to neotest-go in v2.3.2. Elixir tests were silently not running through neotest.

75. **ui.lua — `LOGO_WIDTH` dead variable removed** — declared as `#LOGO_LINES[1]` (byte length, not display columns) with a misleading comment calling box-drawing chars "ASCII". The variable was never read; all decode logic correctly uses `LOGO_COLS_DISPLAY = 64`. Removed entirely.

76. **ui.lua — drain winblend flash fixed** — `trigger_drain()` now resets both rain floats to `winblend=0` before starting the drain timer. Previously the floats held `winblend=100` from creation; the first drain frame computed `blend=0` and snapped the window from transparent to opaque for one frame, causing a visible dark-green background flash at the moment the user pressed a key. The `0→100` fade ramp in `frame()` now begins from the correct baseline.

---

## What Was Changed (v2.3.5 → v2.3.6)

77. **keymaps.lua — Harpoon pcall guards** — All six `require("harpoon")` calls in `<leader>ha/hm/h1–h4` and `<M-1–4>` were bare. If harpoon fails to load (lazy-load not yet triggered) pressing any of these threw an unhandled stack trace. All wrapped in pcall, consistent with the spectre/dap pattern from v2.3.5.

78. **keymaps.lua — todo-comments pcall guards** — `]t` / `[t` called `require("todo-comments")` bare. Same fix applied.

79. **completion.lua — blink.cmp nav keys "show" removed** — `<C-p>/<C-n>/<C-k>/<C-j>` were mapped to `{ "select_prev/next", "show" }`. The `"show"` action calls `"fallback"` internally when the menu is open, re-invoking native `i-^P/i-^N` and opening a competing popup. Mapped to `{ "select_prev" }` / `{ "select_next" }` only.

80. **dap.lua — `"python"` → `"debugpy"` in ensure_installed** — `mason-nvim-dap ensure_installed` listed `"python"` which is not a Mason registry package name. The correct name is `"debugpy"`. Caused a startup warning on every launch and the Python DAP adapter was never auto-installed. Known since v2.2.4; single-token fix.

---

## What Was Changed (v2.3.6 → v2.3.7)

81. **lsp.lua — elixir-ls wired** — `elixir.lua` disables `elixirls` inside `elixir-tools` with the comment "lsp.lua owns elixirls", but `elixir-ls` was never in `mason-lspconfig ensure_installed` and never had a `servers` table entry. Elixir had no LSP unless the user ran `:MasonInstall` manually. Added `"elixir-ls"` to `ensure_installed` and an `elixirls` entry in the `servers` table.

82. **hud.lua (plugins/specs) — mini.animate opts→config migration** — `require("mini.animate")` was called inside `opts=function()`, which lazy evaluates at spec-parse time before mini.animate is installed. On a fresh install this caused a startup error. All `animate.gen_timing` / `gen_subscroll` calls and the `mouse_scrolled` closure moved into `config()` which only runs after the plugin is confirmed loaded.

---

## What Was Changed (v2.3.8 → v2.3.9) — Current

87. **runner.lua — `run_tests()` JS/TS cd prefix** — `detect_js_test_cmd()` returned a bare package-manager command with no `cd <root> &&` prefix. When the shell's cwd differed from the project root, the package manager couldn't locate `package.json` and failed silently. All JS/TS test commands now prefixed with `cd <root> &&`, consistent with every other language.

88. **commands.lua — MasonInstallAll missing `fortls` and `gopls`** — `lsp.lua` wires both as servers but neither was in `MasonInstallAll`. A fresh install had no way to auto-install them via `:MasonInstallAll`. Both added to the LSP section.

89. **dap.lua — Elixir DAP debugger path resolver** — The fallback chain ended with `exepath("elixir-ls")` which resolves to the LSP binary, not the DAP debugger. Using the LSP binary as a DAP adapter silently failed every Elixir debug session. Resolver now only returns a known DAP-capable path (`debugger.sh` or `elixir-ls-debugger`); falls back to nil with a warning rather than wiring the wrong binary.

90. **lsp.lua — `fortls` added to `mason-lspconfig ensure_installed`** — `fortls` was in the optional servers table (binary-checked at runtime) but absent from `ensure_installed`. A fresh install had no way to auto-install it. Consistent with the elixir-ls fix in v2.3.7.

---

## What Was Changed (v2.3.7 → v2.3.8)

83. **test.lua — neotest-vitest constructor** — `neotest-vitest` was returned as a raw module table. neotest-vitest exports a callable constructor; not invoking it silently gave neotest an invalid adapter object and Vitest tests never ran. Fixed: `require("neotest-vitest")({})` — identical fix to neotest-go (v2.3.2) and neotest-elixir (v2.3.5).

84. **runner.lua — `run_tests()` cd prefix for python/rust/go/zig** — These four commands lacked the `cd <root> &&` prefix that ruby/elixir/kotlin/java already had. `pytest` needs `pyproject.toml`/`setup.cfg`; `cargo test` needs `Cargo.toml`; `go test` needs `go.mod`; `zig build test` needs `build.zig`. All four now cd to project root before running.

85. **keymaps.lua — Overseer duplicate maps removed** — `<leader>ot`, `<leader>or`, and `<leader>ob` were registered both here and in `workflow.lua`'s `keys=` table. `workflow.lua` is the sole owner (handles lazy-loading and the smart `run_template` fallback for `<leader>ob`). The duplicates here caused which-key to list each entry twice and silently overwrote `workflow.lua`'s smart build logic.

86. **treesitter.lua — `"comment"` removed from `ignore_install`** — The comment treesitter parser is required by `todo-comments.nvim` (multiline TODO detection) and `noice.nvim` (`long_message_to_split` preset). Ignoring it silently disabled multiline todo highlighting. Only `"vim"` remains in `ignore_install`.

---

## What Was Changed (v2.3.9 → v2.3.10)

91. **test.lua — `once=true` removed from neotest-rust LspAttach** — `once=true` caused the LspAttach autocmd to be permanently consumed by the first LSP that attached, regardless of client name. Any non-rust server (lua_ls, basedpyright, clangd) attaching before rust_analyzer silently discarded the autocmd and neotest-rust was never registered for the session. The `_rust_registered` boolean flag already provides the idempotency guarantee that `once=true` was intended to give. Removed `once=true`; the flag alone is sufficient and correct.

92. **advanced.lua — vim-matchup `config()` standalone `ts.setup()` removed** — `config()` called `nvim-treesitter.configs.setup({ matchup = { enable = true } })` independently. nvim-treesitter treats each `setup()` call as a full reconfiguration; this second call from vim-matchup's `config()` silently overwrote treesitter.lua's complete opts (highlight, indent, textobjects, incremental_selection, etc.) with a near-empty table depending on lazy load order. Fixed: `config()` removed from the vim-matchup spec entirely. A companion `optional=true` nvim-treesitter spec now contributes only the `matchup` key via `opts=function()`, which lazy.nvim merges recursively into the primary treesitter.lua opts — the same pattern used by all lang/* specs.

93. **dap.lua — `"elixir-ls"` added to `mason-nvim-dap ensure_installed`** — The Elixir DAP adapter resolver looks for `mason/packages/elixir-ls/debugger.sh`, but `mason-nvim-dap`'s `ensure_installed` list never included `"elixir-ls"`. `automatic_installation` therefore never pulled the package. Users silently had no working Elixir DAP adapter unless `mason-lspconfig` had already installed it as a side effect. DAP installation must not depend on lspconfig side effects; `"elixir-ls"` is now listed in both.

94. **runner.lua — fortran/vhdl/cobol informational messages** — `run_tests()` emitted the opaque `"No test runner for: <ft>"` WARN message for these three languages with no explanation. These languages have no standard unit-test framework that can be invoked generically. Replaced with `INFO`-level messages that explain why no runner exists and point the user to the language-specific build/run keymaps already defined in each lang spec: `<leader>ftb` (Fortran), `<leader>vhr` (VHDL), `<leader>cob` (COBOL).

> `web` must precede `html`/`css`; `database` must precede `sql`.
> Do not reorder these imports.

## Installation Steps

1. **Backup your current config:**
   ```bash
   mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)
   mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)
   mv ~/.cache/nvim ~/.cache/nvim.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```

2. **Place files into correct locations** using the structure above.

3. **Start Neovim:**
   ```bash
   nvim
   ```
   lazy.nvim bootstraps and installs all plugins on first launch.

4. **Install LSP servers, DAP adapters, formatters, and linters:**
   ```vim
   :MasonInstallAll
   ```

5. **Verify everything is healthy:**
   ```vim
   :checkhealth
   :Lazy health
   ```

Restart Neovim once Mason finishes to ensure all servers attach cleanly.

## Hot-Swap (upgrading without full restart)

For `keymaps.lua` and `commands.lua` — pure Lua, no plugin state:

```vim
:luafile ~/.config/nvim/lua/core/keymaps.lua
:luafile ~/.config/nvim/lua/core/commands.lua
```

For `lsp.lua` — reload the plugin spec:

```vim
:Lazy reload nvim-lspconfig
```

For `test.lua` — reload neotest:

```vim
:Lazy reload neotest
```

For `ui.lua` — the snacks dashboard is `lazy=false`; a full Neovim restart is required for the changes to take effect cleanly.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Plugins not loading / corrupted state**
```bash
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.cache/nvim
nvim   # lazy.nvim reinstalls everything from scratch
```

**LSP not attaching**
```vim
:checkhealth lsp
:LspInfo
```

**Mason package failed to install**
```vim
:MasonInstallAll
:checkhealth mason
```

**Dashboard rain not animating** — snacks.nvim may have loaded before the `SnacksDashboardOpened` autocmd registered. Force-reopen:
```vim
:lua Snacks.dashboard.open()
```

**snacks.nvim dashboard blank** — ensure `folke/snacks.nvim` is specced with `lazy=false, priority=90`. Run `:Lazy install` if newly added.

**Neovim version too old** (openSUSE default repos ship an outdated build)
```bash
sudo zypper ar -f https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/editors/openSUSE_Leap_15.5/ editors
sudo zypper ref && sudo zypper in neovim
```

**Updating plugins, Mason registry, and parsers**
```vim
:Lazy update
:MasonUpdate
:TSUpdate
```
